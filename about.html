    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm a designer based in beautiful British Columbia, Canada.<br>
    I’m passionate about supporting local small businesses by creating designs that truly reflect their values and personality.</p>

    <p>My style leans toward minimal and simple, but I always like to add a touch of playfulness to keep things fresh and engaging. I especially love working on projects that celebrate animals, birds, plants, and the natural world — if you're looking for a logo inspired by nature, you're in good hands!</p>
    
    <p>Outside of design, I’m a proud parent of two kids and share my home with a loyal <a href="#wss">White Swiss Shepherd</a>. Life is busy, but full of joy and inspiration — and that energy finds its way into my work.</p>
    
    <p>Let’s create something meaningful together.</P>

    <h3><a name="wss">About White Swiss Shepherd</a></h3>
    <p>The White Swiss Shepherd is a beautiful, intelligent dog with a pure white coat. It originated from white-coated German Shepherds. In Germany, these white dogs were once unfairly seen as weak and were not accepted. However, breeders in the United States and Canada valued them and worked to protect and develop the breed. In the 1970s, these dogs were brought to Switzerland, where the White Swiss Shepherd was officially recognized as a new breed.<br>        
    Today, White Swiss Shepherds are known for their friendly nature, intelligence, and loyalty. They make excellent family companions and are especially good with children.</p>
